I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Indiana University, passionate about software development, data science, and machine learning. With a solid foundation from my Bachelor's at Dr. Vishwanath Karad MIT World Peace University, I'm driven by the power of data and technology to solve complex problems.

🔭 I've contributed to cutting-edge projects, such as enhancing an Energy Planning System prototype to significantly reduce energy costs for construction firms and developing a fully functional SimCity game replica in just 7 days. My work in Deepfake Audio Detection with XAI has achieved a remarkable 91.5% accuracy, showcasing my ability to blend technical expertise with innovative solutions.

💡 I'm intrigued by the power of data to transform industries and am always on the lookout for challenging projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

👨‍💻 My GitHub is a reflection of my journey in the tech world, featuring projects from Employee Attrition Prediction using PySpark and MongoDB to impactful analysis on the Post-Covid health of patients using Machine Learning and Data Visualization.

🌱 I'm currently diving deeper into Computer Vision and Genetic Algorithms, aiming to leverage these technologies for sustainable and efficient solutions.
